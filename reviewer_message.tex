\section{Response to Reviewer #1}
Comment regarding synaptic normalization: We added a paragraph in the subsection on synaptic normalization, explaining that s.n. does not act as a strict control mechanism of firing rates of individual neurons since it is not sensitive to the actual postsynaptic firing rate.
Parameter tuning: Parameters were taken from a previous publication that used the LIF-SORN (Plasticity-Driven Self-Organization under Topological Constraints Accounts for Non-random Features of Cortical Synaptic Wiring, Miner & Triesch 2016). Furthermore, including short-term plasticity into the model made network activity more robust with respect to parameter changes.
